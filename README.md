## Approach Used
***1.	Data Wrangling***

- Built a database
- Create a table and insert the data.

<br>

***2.	Feature Engineering***

This will help use generate some new columns from existing ones.
- Add a new column named Hours to give insight of sales in the different time intervals. This will help answer the question on which part of the day most sales are made.
- Add a new column named Total_Revenue that contains the total revenue generated by each pizza type, based on time, month or dates. This will help answer the question which pizza type is most demanding on which time interval.

<br>

***3.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)***

- Conducting exploratory data analysis is essential to address the project's listed questions and objectives.
<br>
